   <h1 style=" color: violet;">My Experience</h1>
   <p style=" border: 2px solid;">My first week at AkiraChix was great.First of all, I did not expect to find so many nationalities which greatly shocked me;I was very thrilled to have an Ethiopian and a Rwandese roommate;it has given me a chance to learn about the different cultures and beliefs that everyone holds dear to heart.I love that the Akirachix team greatly cares for all our needs and aims to make sure we are all okay at all capacities without discrimination.My other biggest fascination is about the food that we're served.I did not expect us to be served by professional chefs everyday, and I love the fact that we don't have a specific menu for the meals which makes us always look forward to what's next for lunch or supper.I also how we all have our individual laptops to work on privately and my favorite class so far is the UX Research class.
